# Model Building

In this Problem Statement we have used Four differernt models respectively :

1. Decision Tree
2. KNN Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. SVM

# Conclusion

Upon evaluating all the models we can conclude the following details i.e.

Accuracy:

As far as the accuracy of the model is concerned Logistic Regression performs better than all the other algorithms.
